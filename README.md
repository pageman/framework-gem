Installation
------------

### Set Up Your Dev Environment

Vesper includes almost everything required to write a web app, but first you have to set up your dev environment. Here's what you'll need to get started:
			
Ruby 1.9.3 or above: [http://www.ruby-lang.org/](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)</a>
			
> **Pro Tip:** Using [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) should make this simpler.
			
RubyGems: [https://rubygems.org/](https://rubygems.org/)
			
SQLite: [http://www.sqlite.org/](http://www.sqlite.org/)
			
> You can use a different database (or none at all) -- SQLite is just the default.
			
A text editor and web browser also help. I recommend [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) and [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/).

### Download the Gem
			
Now that you're all set up, installation should be simple.
			
> You may need to sudo this.
			
    gem install vesper
			
That's it! You're ready to start writing web apps with Vesper.
